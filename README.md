Jupyter Notebook written to answer 3 questions on the Seattle Airbnb data set
Data downloaded from: https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle/data

The three questions investigated:
1) Are there large seasonal variations? Which weekdays are cheapest / most expensive? 
2) How strong is the correlation between review score and price paid?  Score / $ ratio
3) What is my expected revenue with an airbnb listing?

Key conclusions for each question:
1) Summer months more expensive, not dramatically. Tuesday & Wednesday cheapest week days, but not significantly cheaper than weekend.
2) Poor correlation - no clear trend observed. Very poor reviews only for the cheapest listings.
3) 67% Occupancy rate and approx 140$ daily rates on average, gives approx 33k$ a year revenue.
